# CourseS
This project is implemented using a combination of py4web, vue.js, css, html, and google cloud sql. For the local version (the one that isn’t deployed on the google app engine), all information was stored on a local database using py4web’s db implementation that was used for a variety of homework assignments. The homework assignments in this class were a huge help in wrapping our heads around how data was connected between vue, controllers, the databases, and the html pages. 

Index.html:

The table was created by using an example that we did previously in a homework assignment. The classes (local) database was pre populated with a json file full of all the CSE classes as UCSC that was made on google sheets and then converted to json using an external website. From there, we used a vue to load data into the webpage by utilizing the URL links that were seen used in example videos posted on Luca’s webpage. We had trouble figuring out how to utilize vue data in the table, but about an hour of googling brought us an answer and we were able to utilize a vue for loop within our table. The favorites buttons were added in and used a similar approach to how liking and disliking worked on a previous homework assignment. We have a database of users, and we inserted a new user for each class and stored the class id and set an int called favorite to 0 (indicating unliked). When the star is clicked, it goes into vue and calls a function to send the new favorite value (1 if star was previously clicked, 0 if star was not previously clicked) and the class id to a stars function in controller.py. This stars function takes these values and goes through the user database and will update the user that has a class_id equal to the id that was passed through vue (the row index of the class that was clicked) and will set the favorite value accordingly. Then, when the index is loaded, it calls load_classes, which goes through the users of the current email and will change a favorite variable in the classes database to match that of the users. The classes database is then sorted by favorite and returned in the dict in this function, sending it to index.html. Index will loop through this list and if the favorite value is 0, an empty star will display, if it is 1, a filled in star will display and immediately be sorted.

Resources.html:

The + button was created using an example that was done in a previous homework where we had to make a comment section. When you click the + a boolean is switched to true and the add resources section appears. These text areas in the add resources section are directly connected to vue when the add button is pressed and are immediately sent to the add_contacts function where it is inserted into the database. The link checks if its a youtube link, and if it is it changes it to an embedded link to properly show on the page. Here you can also add an image, which is connected to the google storage, and we got a majority of the code from Luca’s video on uploading pictures using google storage. If an image is added then its download_url is added into the resources as well, so it can be accessed when printing out the resources. After that is all done, resources loads load_contacts which essentially allows us to access the resources database in resources.html. It runs a vue for loop on this list and checks to see if the current item in the list’s symbol (class symbol ex: ‘cse183’) is equal to a variable passed in called ‘course’. This course variable is passed in from the resources function, it whatever appears after resources/ in the url. If those two match up, then it is a resource on this specific page and we can print this resource. First checks if the user that created the resource is equal to the current user email. If it is, then we know that we are allowed to delete this item, so a deletion button shows up in the tile. It then runs some checks to see whether we have a link (and whether the link is a youtube video or not), if we have an image, or if we just have a title and description and will process the showing of the resources differently for each different scenario. We also have a like/dislike button that works very similarly to how the favorite button works on index. We stored the specific like value for each specific user at each specific resource so that we could have separate like/dislikes for each user and included a total like and dislike counter that shows up next to each button.
